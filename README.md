Requires tkinter, which I think should come with Python, but my experience is that has not always been the case.

To run simply `python App.py` or `python3 App.y`.

Tested with Python 3.4.3, should work with other versions though as it doesn't do anything super advanced. Just make sure tkinter is installed.
